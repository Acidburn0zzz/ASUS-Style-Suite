<p align="center">Hello</p>



<p align="center">There is a simple module that contain:
Wallpapers from ASUS for their Android phones
- ASUS ROG Phone Live Wallpaper app
- ASUS ROG Phone Theme app
</p>


All credit @linuxct for having shared the ASUS suite tools (original XDA thread).
This module is just a portage of that.

<p align="center">Compatibility:</p>
- Magisk (last stable version at least)
- An Android phone (oh really ? )
- 5 minutes of your time
- (download, install, reboot and set the wallpaper take too much of your time? REALLY ? )
    This should works on any Android Device

<p align="center">Enjoy
